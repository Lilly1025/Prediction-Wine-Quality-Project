# **Red Wine Prediction**
## Description
**Red Wine Prediction** is Machine Learning project for 01418362 
(Introduction to Machine Learning). This project use red wine dataset from [Vinho Verde] 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality 

The goal is to model wine quality based on **all** and **Selected features** of physicochemical with Support Vector Machine
target is Quality that:
* quality <= 5 is bad wine
* quality > 5 is good wine
## Data Information
Input Variables:
* **fixed acidity:** most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile
* **volatile acidity:** the amount of acetic acid in wine
* **citric acid:** found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines
* **residual sugar:** the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops
* **chlorides:** the amount of salt in the wine
* **free sulfur dioxide:** the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion
* **total sulfur dioxide:** amount of free and bound forms of S02
* **density:** the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content
* **pH:** describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic)
* **sulphates:** a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels
* **alcohol:** the percent alcohol content of the wine

Output Variable:
* quality: output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10)
